Sagrada embodies a minimalist design philosophy while delivering an innovative typing experience. The board is inspired by the grandeur of Antoni Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia, yet it achieves elegance through simplicity in both its aesthetics and engineering.

At its core is a plateless PCB leaf-spring mounting system, designed to provide a soft, responsive, and enjoyable typing feel. The internals are straightforward, prioritizing ease of machining and assembly, ensuring the board is as functional as it is beautiful.

Sagrada celebrates the harmony between form and function, whether you're marveling at its stunning design or enjoying its unique feel, it’s a keyboard that invites exploration and enjoyment.
