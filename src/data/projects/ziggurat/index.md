Ziggurat 65XT is influenced by ancient temples in Mesopotamia. Nowadays, Ziggurats can be seen as ancient temples, modern architectural works, and have even inspired futuristic designs, such as Blade Runner. The Ziggurat symbolizes opulence, power, and shared common vision to unite us all.

The idea was to create a keyboard that prioritizes a bouncy typing experience, clean acoustics, and a design language that would look great, even back in 3000 BC.
