The Leviatán is a versatile 60% keyboard designed for enthusiasts who value customization and sound tuning. Its defining feature is the ability to choose between mounting styles, including top mount and PCB mount, each catering to different preferences for feel and acoustics.

The board supports a tray-style plate that overlays the PCB, allowing further tuning of the board's flex and sound. Whether you prefer a completely plateless build or the refined resonance of a half-plate setup, the Leviatán caters to all.

The Leviatán is not just a keyboard—it’s a playground for tuning enthusiasts. Whether you lean towards traditional top mount builds or want to experiment with the nuanced sound profiles of the PCB mount system, this board offers something for everyone.
