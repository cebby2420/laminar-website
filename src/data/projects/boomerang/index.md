Boomerang is a straightforward yet refined take on a beloved layout. Inspired by the FLX Virgo but tailored for those who prefer a more streamlined design without the navigation cluster, this keyboard is the result of a simple motivation: "I wanted something, so I made it."

The board’s standout feature is its mounting system, which emphasizes ease and accuracy. An o-ring slots neatly into cutouts on the tabs, with the plate perfectly aligned by design. The self-aligning mechanism ensures the o-ring stays constrained within channels underneath, preventing any misalignment in both up-down and side-side directions. This clever approach guarantees a consistent and hassle-free assembly process.

Boomerang doesn’t aim to reinvent the wheel—it’s designed to meet a specific need with elegance and functionality. Whether you appreciate its minimalist ethos or are just drawn to its clean lines and practicality, Boomerang is ready to deliver.
