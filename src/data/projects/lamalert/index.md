Born out of a passion for retro aesthetics and an ambition to bring accessible keycap options to the community, DCS Lam Alert is the beige sibling to the iconic DCS Red Alert. What started as a personal quest to find the elusive Red Alert base kit became a project to offer not just one, but two colorways: merging classic appeal with a fresh, retro spin.
